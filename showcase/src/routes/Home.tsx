                <p>
                    My name is Quinn Rohlf, and I'm a roaming engineer/designer based in the western United States.
                    Trianglify is an open-source library I wrote to generate low-poly style patterns by combining a
                    Delaunay triangulation with some nice colors. It was originally released in April of 2014. It has a
                    sibling project, Trianglify.io, that provides a user-friendly GUI for the library and helps fund
                    library development and bugfixes via paid downloads.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Trianglify v4.0.0, released May 2020, was a ground-up modernized rewrite of the original source. You
                    can read about the changes in v4 here.
                </p>

                <p>Trianglify was originally inspired by @jasonlong's GeoPattern library for Ruby.</p>
